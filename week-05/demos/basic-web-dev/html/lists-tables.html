    <!-- 
        The goal for this webpage is to write out a grilled salmon recipe. Typically recipe pages have several
        different sections with them:
            - A list of ingredients
            - Steps to cook the ingredients
            - Nutritional Facts

        These 3 elements link up pretty nicely with 3 different kinds of elements that we see in html pages: 
            - Unordered Lists
            - Ordered Lists
            - Tables
    -->

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!-- 
        To make an ingredients list, typically this is a bulleted list of items that can be grabbed in 
        any order. This is a candidate for an unordered list
    -->
    <!-- UL is unordered list and LI is list item -->
    <ul>
        <li>A large slab of salmon 
            <!-- <img src="./salmon-fillets.jpg" height="100px"> -->

        <li>Preheat grill to 400 degrees F</li>

    <h2>Nutritional Facts</h2>
    <!-- A nutritional facts table includes information about a specific component or nutrient and the amount
     contained in the dish -->

    <table>
        <!-- This is used to build a table
            The first row is our HEADERS so we'll use a th tag instead of td
            In each cell to fill it out we use a td tag
            Rows start with a tr tag
        -->
        <tr>
            <th>Nutrient</th>
            <th>Amount Per Serving</th>
