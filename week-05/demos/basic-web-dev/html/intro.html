<!-- 
    This is a single or multiline comment in HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it's used
    to define the structure and basic content of our web pages. The styling of pages will be done with CSS and
    the functionality of our pages will be done with JS.

    HTML is comprised of 2 major things: elements and attributes. Elements define what is on the page and 
    attributes can change that info in some way
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The very first line in any HTML file is the doctype directive which tells the browser what kind of file it
    is looking at. This says html which specifically refers to HTML5 which is the current version standard
-->

<!-- Elements are going to fill the page, typically they have an opening and a closing tag: <p> </p>
    and content is defined between these tags.
-->

<html>
    <!-- The HTML tag is the ROOT tag for the entire html page and everything we want will live inside of it
        The two major tags under HTML is head and body 
    -->

    <head>
        <!-- 
            The head tag/element is a place where you define certain pieces of metadata about your webpage
            Typically the things here do not end up directly visible on the page but they're still important
            to have

            Common HTML Head tags
            - <title> used for the title of the webpage (tabname)
            - <style> used for internal CSS styling of the webpage
            - <script> used to inject some JS into the page
            - <link> links to external resources, typically stylesheets
            - <meta> used for metadata and SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
        -->

        <title>HTML Basics</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- 
            This is the real content of your webpage. Everything we write inside of here will be directly
            rendered on the webpage itself.

            There are a variety of tags we can use, some of them are listed below (not exhaustive):
            <h#> - Used for headers ranging from size 1-6 (h1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest)
            <p> - Used for general paragraphs
            <input> - used for taking in input
            <b> - used for bolding
            <img> - used for images
            <ol>, <ul>, <li> - Used for creating different types of lists
            <table> - used for tables
            <div> - Used for a logical division of the page or grouping of elements
            <a> - Used for linking to another page
        -->

            Does HTML care about whitespace?
            <!-- Typically no unless we add in some explicit whitespace -->
        </p>

        <br>
        <!-- A <br> tag is a break element that allows us to add in a little bit of space on our pages -->

        <!-- 
            Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to other webpages whether inside your project structure or 
            some external page as well. To define an achor tag we start with what you might expect.

            To make the anchor tag work we need an attribute. Attributes go along with elements and use key-value
            pairs to provide details about the element or change its functionality

            Global Attributes (Can be applied to every element):
            - class
            - id
            - hidden
            - style

            Other elements have specific attributes like href for the <a> tag
