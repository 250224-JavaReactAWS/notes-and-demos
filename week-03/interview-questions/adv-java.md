## REST: Representational State Transfer
- What is [REST](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)?

REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

- What makes an API RESTful?
  - *i.e **What are the 6 constraints of REST?***
  - Uniform Interface
  - Client-Server
  - Stateless
  - Cacheable
  - Layered System
  - Code on Demand (Optional)

- What is the [Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html)?
